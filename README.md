# boxing-class-constructor
A class constructor of Boxers made with C#

This is a small C# command line app that displays some information about some boxers that I like. 
There is a class and a constructor to create the new fighter with some conditional statements to determine the fighter's pound for pound ranking, whether or not they hold a world title, etc.
